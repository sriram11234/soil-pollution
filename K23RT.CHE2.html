        <h2 style="font-size:30px;">What Is Soil pollution?</h2>
        <p  style="font-size: 20px;">Soil pollution is defined as the presence of toxic chemicals (pollutants or contaminants) in soil,<br> in high enough concentrations to pose a risk to human health and/or the ecosystem. <br>In the case of coxntaminants which occur naturally in soil, even when their levels are not high <br>enough to pose a risk, soil pollution is still said to occur if the levels of the contaminants in soil exceed the levels that should naturally be present.Soil pollution can have harmful effects on all living organisms, such as plants, animals, and humans. For example, exposure to soil containing high concentrations of benzene increases the risk of contracting leukaemia. Living, working, or playing in the contaminated soil can lead to respiratory diseases, skin diseases, and other diseases<br>.This invisible affliction appears when the concentration of pollutants on the surface becomes so high that it harms land biodiversity and endangers health, particularly through food. Activities such as stock breeding and intensive farming use chemicals, pesticides and fertilisers that pollute the land, just as happens with heavy metals and other natural and man-made chemical substances.<br>This invisible affliction appears when the concentration of pollutants on the surface becomes so high that it harms land biodiversity and endangers health, particularly through food.<br> Activities such as stock breeding and intensive farming use chemicals, pesticides and fertilisers that pollute the land, just as happens with heavy metals and other natural and man-made chemical substances.    
            Soil pollution is a global threat that is particularly serious in regions like Europe, Eurasia, Asia and North Africa, as indicated by the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations . It is also affirms that both intense and even moderate degradation is already affecting one third of the world's soil. Moreover, recovery is so slow that it would take 1,000 years to create a few centimetres layer of arable soil.</p>

        <P style="font-size: 20px;">Eat sustainable foodstuffs, properly recycle batteries, produce homemade compost and dispose of drugs in the places authorised for this purpose.</p>

        <p style="font-size: 20px;">Food security is an essential consideration for the government in the UK but also on an international level.
            By 2050, it is believed that food production will have to double by 100% to feed the 9 billion people on
            earth1.
            This is alarming, and it could mean that even more food is wasted. As a result, the government of almost
            every
            country in the world needs to create initiatives and campaigns to help make people aware of the food waste
            problem
            and establish sustainable food systems.We should consider individuals and businesses in this mix. While this
            is
            a
            form of education, it is a problem that they need to tackle with compelling advertising campaigns.</p>

        <h2 style="font-size: 30px;">How To Prevent Soil pollution ?</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                The use of bio-fertilizers and manures can help to reduce the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Biological pest management approaches can help reduce the use of pesticides, reducing soil contamination.<br>
                
                ·         Material recovery and recycling
                This is a fair way to reduce soil pollution. Materials such as paper, some plastics, and glass are recycled. This reduces the volume of waste produced and aids in the conservation of natural resources. One tonne of recovered paper, for example, can save 17 trees.<br>
                
                ·         Reforesting
                Controlling land loss and soil erosion can be addressed by restoring forest and grass cover, to mitigate wastelands, soil erosion, and flooding. Crop rotation or mixed cropping can boost soil fertility.<br>
                
                ·         Treatment of solid waste
                Solid waste disposal should be managed using proper ways. Industrial wastes can be physically, chemically, and biologically treated to make them less harmful.<br>
                
                Acidic and alkaline wastes should be neutralized first, while insoluble materials, if biodegradable, should be allowed to decompose under controlled conditions before disposal. As a last resort, new places for hazardous waste storage, such as deep well injection and more secure landfills should be examined.
                
                Burying solid waste in locations away from residential areas is the most basic, and extensively utilized method of solid waste management.
                
                ·         Chemical procedures
                The two alternative approaches are to treat the soil in suspension in a suitable liquid and without sludging. In these cases, intimate contact between soil and chemical is required, and should be repeated on a regular basis to ensure that the detoxification process is completed.<br>
                
               
                •        Eat sustainable foods, recycle batteries properly, prepare homemade compost, and dispose of pharmaceuticals in specified sites.<br>
                
                •        Promote a more environmentally friendly model for manufacturing, agriculture, and stock breeding, among other economic activities.<br>
                
                •        Enhance urban planning, transportation planning, and waste water treatment.<br>
                
                •        Improve mining waste management, rehabilitate the landscape, and save topsoil.<br>
                
                •        Include indigenous peoples and local communities in the design, implementation, and evaluation of sustainable land and soil management.<br>

                Conclusion
                To control soil contamination, the following steps have been proposed. We can limit construction in sensitive locations to assist minimize soil erosion. In general, if we could all practice the three R's: Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle. This would result in less solid waste.
                
                It is also critical to organize the numerous researches into a framework or decision support system, which is open and accessible to all citizens. To deal with these uncertainties, a weight of evidence method may be an obvious solution.
                
                How can we assist?
                To protect our environment, we offer a variety of modern solutions such as solid waste management, wastewater treatment, sewage treatment, water treatment, etc. For this purpose, we manufacture a variety of water treatment plants, wastewater treatment plants, effluent treatment plants, solid waste recyclers, green waste recyclers,</p>

            <h2>How soil pollution Disposed?</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Soil pollution used to be a local issue, mostly associated to unsustainable activities such as uncontrolled waste disposal; but during the last decades, it has received wider attention, having becoming a general environmental problem. Soil pollution may result from both intended and unintended activities, covering direct emissions to soil and complex environmental processes resulting in the indirect contamination of soils following emissions to air or water. On-site industrial pollution and inadequate waste management, mining activities, direct intentional applications of materials to soil, and atmospheric deposition are the main sources of soil pollution. Soils offer support for natural ecosystems as well as most human activities; therefore, the consequences of soil pollution, both for human health and the environment, are directly related to the soil uses. Pollution of agricultural soils may affect sustainability and safety of food production, while pollution of recreational soils is of particularly concern regarding children health, as exposure in playgrounds may be significant; in fact ingestion of significant amounts of soil has been reported particularly for toddlers and</p>
